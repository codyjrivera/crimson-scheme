# crimson-scheme -- A recursive Scheme interpreter written in C++.
By Cody Rivera

This is a simple tree-walk intepreter that implements the Scheme programming language.

So far, a recursive-descent parser and a pretty printer have been implemented.

Go to src and type "make" to build, and ./cri-scm to run.
